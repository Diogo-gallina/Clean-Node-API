# Clean Node - API
Dedicated API for clean architecture studies and test-driven development (TDD)

### Design Patterns Covered:

- **Adapter**
  The Adapter pattern is used to allow incompatible interfaces to work together. It converts the interface of a class into another interface that clients expect. This is useful when existing systems need to collaborate without modifying their original interfaces.

- **Decorator**
  The Decorator pattern is used to dynamically add additional behaviors to objects without modifying their basic structure. This is achieved by creating a series of classes that wrap around the original object and provide additional functionalities as needed.

- **Composite**
  The Composite pattern is designed to treat individual objects and compositions of objects uniformly. It allows clients to treat individual objects and compositions of objects uniformly. This is useful in hierarchical structures where objects can be parts or larger sets.

- **Factory Method**
  The Factory Method pattern defines an interface for creating an object but allows subclasses to decide which class to instantiate. This enables a class to defer object creation to subclasses, facilitating the choice of the type of object to be created at runtime.

These patterns are widely used in software development to address common design and code structuring problems, providing flexibility, reusability, and separation of concerns.
